code repo for Assignment 4 of CSCI-E 75 Dynamic Web Applications class

This project will be an implementation of the card game "Hi-Lo", which is essentially a mini-game that I have seem
played on Zynga Poker.  What is unique about this project is that I will be using the Meteor (www.meteor.com)
JavaScript framework to make this a dynamic client/server application where updates will be pushed to other people's
browsers to see updates (e.g., they won't need to refresh their browsers to see changes made at the data layer).
